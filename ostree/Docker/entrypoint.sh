## UID/GID Management

# We need to manage uid/gid inside a container because the workspace
# VOLUME and the ssh agent authentication socket are shared between
# inside and outside.  We explicit capture the users uid and gid at
# 'docker run' and arrange for an entrypoint to create the necessary
# user on the fly.

# We need a username, but it doesn't matter what the name is, we only
# care that uid/gid are anchored correctly.

username="user"

# These environment variables are typically set by
# docker run -e LOCAL_UID=$(id -u) -e LOCAL_GID=$(id -g)

LOCAL_UID=${LOCAL_UID:-9001}
LOCAL_GID=${LOCAL_GID:-9001}
