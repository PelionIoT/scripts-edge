# scripts-Pelion-Edge

This repository contains scripts that are useful with the Izuma Networks Edge offering.

## Firmware update scripts

There are three script sets for [firmware updates](https://developer.izumanetworks.com/docs/device-management-edge/latest/updating/index.html):

- Scripts for the Izuma Edge active offering, targets based on [Linux microPlatform (LmP)](https://github.com/PelionIoT/scripts-pelion-edge/tree/master/ostree) with OSTree-based update mechanisms.
- Scripts for the legacy offering, [plain Yocto-based targets](https://github.com/PelionIoT/scripts-pelion-edge/tree/master/legacy-yocto).
- Helper scripts for [combined update](https://github.com/PelionIoT/scripts-pelion-edge/tree/master/combined-update).

Choose your script folder accordingly.
